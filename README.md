# A Starter Notebook for Regression

Methods included in this notebook are:

- Linear regression (`scikit-learn`)
- Huber regression (`scikit-learn`)
- Gradient boosting machine (`xgboost`)
- Densely connected neural network (`keras`)
- Linear regression through pre-made tensorflow estimator (`tensorflow`)
> Used the `tf.data` to pipeline data loading, and feed data to estimator.
